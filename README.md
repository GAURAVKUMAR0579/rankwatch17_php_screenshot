# rankwatch17_php_screenshot


here the task is to get the screenshot of the submitted url(without http). You can do this by a lot of available js frameworks. I have Google PageSpeed Insights API with php. You will need to run the index.php file. Screenshot will be save at "scrnsht" folder in jpeg format. Screensot will be save with name which is same as url.
